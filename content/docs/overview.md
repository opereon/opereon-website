# What is Opereon?

[Opereon](https://opereon.io) is a configuration management and automation system for IT, similar in function to the 
other solutions like:

- [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) 
- [Puppet](https://puppet.com) and [Puppet Bolt](https://puppet.com/products/bolt)
- [Chef](https://www.chef.io)
- [SaltStack](https://www.saltstack.com)

It is essentially a remote task runner, capable of performing administrative tasks on hosts using Unix-like systems, 
using SSH protocol. It does not require any particular software to be installed on managed (remote) hosts, except 
of course for a working SSH server. Task are basically just system commands or shell scripts, so they can be implemented
in any programming language the user see fit.
