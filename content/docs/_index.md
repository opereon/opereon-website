[Opereon](https://opereon.io) is an alternative approach for IT automation. It is an open source tool 
for automatic orchestration of resources in ICT infrastructure. It can be used to perform any administrative
tasks on Unix-like hosts. 

Opereon does not require any agent installed on remote hosts, and uses internally an [OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/)
client to perform remote administrative tasks. This ensures that everything works exactly as it would when the user 
would perform the same tasks manually.

This documentation is divided into several chapters, with summaries as follow.
